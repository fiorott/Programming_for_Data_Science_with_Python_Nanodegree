# Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree 
This is a certified Nanodegree course on - `Data Science programming` at `Udacity` learning platform.
More details on the Nanodegree and the project can be accessed using this Link on [Programming for Data Science with Python](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

## The Aim of the course:
To Learn the programming fundamentals required for a career in data science using Python language. Study the relational databases and interact with them using Postgre SQL language. And use GIT version control tool to publish the work online. By the end of the program, was able to use Python, SQL, Command Line, and Git.

Created in collaboration with industry experts:
+ [Tableau Software](https://www.tableau.com/)
+ [Mode Analytics](https://mode.com/)

## Program Curriculam:
+ **Introduction to SQL**
Learned SQL fundamentals such as JOINs, Aggregations, Subqueries and advanced Window functions.
Learned how to use SQL to answer complex business problems.
**Project 1:** [`INVESTIGATE A DATABASE`](https://github.com/vamshi-krishna-prime/Business_Analytics/tree/master/Interpret%20a%20Data%20Visualization) 

  > In this project, investigated a relational database while working with PostgreSQL. Completed the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question, running appropriate SQL queries to answer the questions, and finished by sharing the findings.

+ **Introduction to Python Programming**
Learned Python programming fundamentals such as data structures, variables, loops, and functions.
Learned to work with data using libraries like NumPy and Pandas
**Project 2:** `Explore US Bikeshare Data`
  > In this project, used Python to answer analytical questions about bikeshare trip data collected from three US cities. wrote code to collect the data, compute descriptive statistics, and create an interactive experience in the terminal that presents the answers to the questions.

+ **Introduction to Version Control**
Learned how to use version control and share your work with other people in the data science industry.
**Project 3:** `Post your work on Github`
  > In this project, learned important tools that all programmers use. First, got introduced to working in the terminal. Next, learnt to use git and Github to manage versions of a program and collaborate with others on programming projects. Posted two different versions of a Jupyter Notebook capturing the learnings from the course, and added commits to the project Git repository.
