/* WHat is the difference between above two queries? */
/*
Expert Tip
If you recall from earlier lessons on joins, the join clause is evaluated
before the where clause -- filtering in the join clause will eliminate rows
before they are joined, while filtering in the WHERE clause will leave those
rows in and produce some nulls.

/* Need explanation on how NULLs are formed along with example*/
