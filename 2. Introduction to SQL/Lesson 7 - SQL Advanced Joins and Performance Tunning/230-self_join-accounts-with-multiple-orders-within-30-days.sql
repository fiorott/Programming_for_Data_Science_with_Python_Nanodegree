/*
In the above query 28 days were used while we need to calculate the orders
within 30 days.

Explanation:
As within 30 days it we should use 29 days. But in SQL timestamps adding
directly 29 days to the timestamp will include the next day after 29 days.
See this behaviour in queries related to time and date. Hemce 28 days are used.
