Expert Tip
If you recall from earlier lessons on joins, the join clause is evaluated
before the where clause -- filtering in the join clause will eliminate rows
before they are joined, while filtering in the WHERE clause will leave those
rows in and produce some nulls.
-----------
1. We are filtering in the JOIN clause in the above query, then why are we still
getting NULLS?

 Ans. Because we are using LEFT JOIN, which means the rows that does not satisfy
 the condition also remains with NULL values in them. See the queries number
 2 and 3 from bottom to better understanding
-----------
2. What is the difference between using the 'WHERE clause' and
'conditional JOIN' ? Both achieve the same result without any NULLS.
-----------
3. Also according to the expert tip mentioned above, filtering the rows using
WHERE clause will leave the rows in and produce NULLs, which is not the case
in the last query.
