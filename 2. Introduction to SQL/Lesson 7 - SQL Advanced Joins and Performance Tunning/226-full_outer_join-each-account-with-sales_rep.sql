Advanced JOINs:

Section 3: FULL OUTER JOIN
*/

/*
You’re not likely to use FULL JOIN (which can also be written as
FULL OUTER JOIN) too often, but the syntax is worth practicing anyway.
LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN each return unmatched rows from one of the
tables—FULL JOIN returns unmatched rows from both tables. FULL JOIN is
commonly used in conjunction with aggregations to understand the amount
of overlap between two tables.

Say you're an analyst at Parch & Posey and you want to see:

Question 1: (must datisfy both conditions given below in single query)
1. Each account who has a sales rep and each sales rep that has an account
(all of the columns in these returned rows will be full)

2. but also each account that does not have a sales rep and each sales rep that
does not have an account (some of the columns in these returned rows will
be empty)

SELECT *
FROM accounts a
FULL OUTER JOIN sales_reps s
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
