UNION only appends distinct values. More specifically, when you use UNION, the
dataset is appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly
identical to rows in the first table are dropped. If you’d like to append all
the values from the second table, use UNION ALL. You’ll likely use UNION ALL
far more often than UNION.
