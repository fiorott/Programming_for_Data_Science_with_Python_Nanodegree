There are extra rows compared to first main query because, this query managed
to obtain rows with NULL values in any one of the aggregation columns (counts).
See the first row for detailed understanding. Hence this query is not only
tuned for performance but also more accurate than previous query.

We used COALESCE in the above query because if there are dates in web_events
that are not present in orders.date, then the NULL values will be filled With
web_evnts.date values.
