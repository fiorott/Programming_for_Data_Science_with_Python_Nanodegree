For this set of quiz questions, you are going to be working with a single table
in the environment below. This is a different dataset than Parch & Posey, as

Question 4:

SELECT SUBSTRING(date FROM 7 FOR 4) || '-' || SUBSTRING(date FROM 1 FOR 2) || '-' || SUBSTRING(date FROM 4 FOR 2) AS correct_date
FROM sf_crime_data
LIMIT 10;
