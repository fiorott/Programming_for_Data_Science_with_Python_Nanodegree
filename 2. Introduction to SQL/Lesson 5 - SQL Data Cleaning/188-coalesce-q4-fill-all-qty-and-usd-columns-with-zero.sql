COALESCE Quizzes

You learned about how to use COALESCE to work with NULL values. Unfortunately,
our dataset does not have the NULL values that were fabricated in this dataset,
so you will work through a different example in the next concept to get used to
the COALESCE function.

-----------Note: Database for these queries are not available locally-----------

Question 4:
Use COALESCE to fill in each of the qty and usd columns with '0' for the
table in 1.

SELECT COALESCE(a.id, a.id) filled_id, a.name, a.website, a.lat, a.long, a.primary_poc, a.sales_rep_id, COALESCE(o.account_id, a.id) account_id, o.occurred_at, COALESCE(o.standard_qty, 0) standard_qty, COALESCE(o.gloss_qty,0) gloss_qty, COALESCE(o.poster_qty,0) poster_qty, COALESCE(o.total,0) total, COALESCE(o.standard_amt_usd,0) standard_amt_usd, COALESCE(o.gloss_amt_usd,0) gloss_amt_usd, COALESCE(o.poster_amt_usd,0) poster_amt_usd, COALESCE(o.total_amt_usd,0) total_amt_usd
FROM accounts a
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE o.total IS NULL;
