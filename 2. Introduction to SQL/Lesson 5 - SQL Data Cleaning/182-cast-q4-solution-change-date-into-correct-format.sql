For this set of quiz questions, you are going to be working with a single table
in the environment below. This is a different dataset than Parch & Posey, as
all of the data in that particular dataset were already clean.

-----------Note: Database for these queries are not available locally-----------

Question 4:

01/31/2014 08:00:00 AM +0000

The correct SQL date format is (yyyy-mm-dd)

SELECT date orig_date, (SUBSTR(date, 7, 4) || '-' || LEFT(date, 2) || '-' || SUBSTR(date, 4, 2)) new_date
FROM sf_crime_data;
