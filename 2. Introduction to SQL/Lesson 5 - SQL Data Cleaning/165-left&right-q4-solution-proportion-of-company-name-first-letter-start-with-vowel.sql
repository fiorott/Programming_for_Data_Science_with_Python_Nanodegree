Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names start
with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?

RESULT:
vowels	     other
80	         271

/*
There are 80 company names that start with a vowel and 271 that start with
other characters. Therefore 80/351 are vowels or 22.8%. Therefore, 77.2% of
company names do not start with vowels.
