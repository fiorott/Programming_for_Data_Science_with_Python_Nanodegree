Consider vowels as a, e, i, o, and u. What proportion of company names start
with a vowel, and what percent start with anything else?

/*
IMPORTANT:
1. convert all coompanies names into upper case or lower case letters, to count
all vowels irrespective of letter case.
2. In the CASE, must use capital vowels since all the companies names are
converted in to upper case letters
3. Must multiply with 0.01 to the denominator in the main query to find percentages
otherwise it will either result in 'zero division error' or returns value '0'.
