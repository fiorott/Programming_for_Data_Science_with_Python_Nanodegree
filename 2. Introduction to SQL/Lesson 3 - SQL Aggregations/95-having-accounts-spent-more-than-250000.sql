/*
WHERE clause does not work on aggregated columns, and HAVING is used instead

HAVING - Expert Tip:

HAVING is the “clean” way to filter a query that has been aggregated, but this
is also commonly done using a subquery. Essentially, any time you want to
perform a WHERE on an element of your query that was created by an aggregate,
you need to use HAVING instead.
