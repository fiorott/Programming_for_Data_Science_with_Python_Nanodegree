Answer:
id	   company	         channel	     use_of_channel

Given Solution:

SELECT a.id, a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) use_of_channel
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id

/*
Note: This query above (both) only works if there are no ties for the account that
used facebook the most. It is a best practice to use a larger limit number
first such as 3 or 5 to see if there are ties before using LIMIT 1.
*/

/*
Also sometimes facebook might be used by two companies same number of times. So,
do use LIMIT 4 or 5 to check the possibel clash scenario.
