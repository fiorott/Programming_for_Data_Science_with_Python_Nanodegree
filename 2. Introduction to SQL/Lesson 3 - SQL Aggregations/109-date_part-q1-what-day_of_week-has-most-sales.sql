When we look at the yearly totals, you might notice that 2013 and 2017 have
much smaller totals than all other years. If we look further at the monthly
data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is only one month of sales for each
of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017). Therefore, neither of these are
evenly represented. Sales have been increasing year over year, with 2016 being
the largest sales to date. At this rate, we might expect 2017 to have the
largest sales.

individual usd spent in each month in a desired year can be listed using the
below query:
