If we look further at the monthly data, we see that for 2013 and 2017 there is
only one month of sales for each of these years (12 for 2013 and 1 for 2017).
Therefore, neither of these are evenly represented. In order for this to be
'fair', we should remove the sales from 2013 and 2017. For the same reasons as
discussed above.

Solution:
