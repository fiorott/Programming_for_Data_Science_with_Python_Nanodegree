Notice that MIN and MAX are aggregators that again ignore NULL values. Check
the expert tip below for a cool trick with MAX & MIN.

Expert Tip
Functionally, MIN and MAX are similar to COUNT in that they can be used on
non-numerical columns. Depending on the column type, MIN will return the
lowest number, earliest date, or non-numerical value as early in the alphabet
as possible. As you might suspect, MAX does the opposite—it returns the
highest number, the latest date, or the non-numerical value closest
alphabetically to “Z.”
