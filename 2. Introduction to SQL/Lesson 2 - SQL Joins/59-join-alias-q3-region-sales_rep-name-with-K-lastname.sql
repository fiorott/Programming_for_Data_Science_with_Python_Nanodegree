Provide a table that provides the region for each sales_rep along with their
associated accounts. This time only for accounts where the sales rep has a
last name starting with K and in the Midwest region. Your final table should
include three columns: the region name, the sales rep name, and the
account name. Sort the accounts alphabetically (A-Z) according to account name.
