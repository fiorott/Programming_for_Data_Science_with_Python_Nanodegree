Imagine yourself as a 'Sales Manager' at 'Parch and Posey', You've determined
that another great way to expand revenue is to sell new types of paper to the
existing customers. On order to figure out the best prospects, you'd like to
see existing customers whose orders omitted some type of paper.

Find all the customers who left out atleast one type of paper in their orders.
find customer data as in account_id, occurred_at, standard_qty, gloss_qty and
poster_qty
*/


SELECT account_id, occurred_at, standard_qty, gloss_qty, poster_qty
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty = 0 OR gloss_qty = 0 OR poster_qty = 0;


/*
Similar to the AND operator, the OR operator can combine multiple statements.
Each time you link a new statement with an OR, you will need to specify the
column you are interested in looking at. You may link as many statements as
you would like to consider at the same time. This operator works with all of
the operations we have seen so far including arithmetic operators (+, *, -, /),
LIKE, IN, NOT, AND, and BETWEEN logic can all be linked together using the OR
operator.

When combining multiple of these operations, we frequently might need to use
parentheses to assure that logic we want to perform is being executed correctly.
