/*
In most SQL environments, although not in our Udacity's classroom, you can use
single or double quotation marks - and you may NEED to use double quotation
marks if you have an apostrophe within the text you are attempting to pull.

In our Udacity SQL workspaces, note you can include an apostrophe by putting
two single quotes together. For example, Macy's in our workspace would
be 'Macy''s'.
