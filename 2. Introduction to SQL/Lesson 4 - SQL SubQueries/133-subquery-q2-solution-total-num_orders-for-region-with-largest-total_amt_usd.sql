Question 2:
For the region with the largest (sum) of sales total_amt_usd, how many
total (count) orders were placed?
*/

/*Do check out the solution involving WITH statements in 148, 149 query*/

/*Step by Step solution provided : Smaller than 132 query*/

/* The first query I wrote was to pull the total_amt_usd for each region. */

SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name;

/* Then we just want the region with the max amount from this table. There are
two ways I considered getting this amount. One was to pull the max using a
subquery. Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.
*/

SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o

             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY r.name) sub;

/*Finally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:*/

SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o

              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);

/*
This provides the result as :
Northeast with 2357 orders
*/
