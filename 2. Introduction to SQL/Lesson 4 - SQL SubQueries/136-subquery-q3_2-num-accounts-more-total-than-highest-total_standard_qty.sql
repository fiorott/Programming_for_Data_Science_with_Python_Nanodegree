Question 3:
How many accounts had more total purchases than total standard_qty paper of an
account throughout their lifetime as a customer?

Here total > highest_standard_qty of an account
*/

/*STEP1: List accounts with highest total standard qty purchases*/

SELECT o.account_id, SUM(o.standard_qty) AS total_standard_qty
FROM orders o
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;


/*STEP2: Extract the highest for the total standard qty purchase*/

SELECT MAX(total_standard_qty)

/*RESULT: 41617 */


/*STEP 3: Filter accounts with more total_qty than highest total_standard_qty*/

Result:
