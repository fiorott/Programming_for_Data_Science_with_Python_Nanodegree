Question 4:
For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a
customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?
*/

/*Do check the alternate solution/approach in the next query 138 and 152, 153 */

/*STEP1: Display the most spent customer list */

SELECT a.name AS company, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) AS total_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1

/*STEP2: Extract the highest spent customer name */

/*STEP3: Find the count of web_events in each channel related to the most
spent customer */
