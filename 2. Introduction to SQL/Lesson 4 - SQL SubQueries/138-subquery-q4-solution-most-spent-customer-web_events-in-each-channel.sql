Question 4:
For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a
customer) total_amt_usd, how many web_events did they have for each channel?
*/

/*Do check out the solution involving WITH statements in 152, 153 query*/

/*Here, we first want to pull the customer with the most spent in
lifetime value. */

SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent

ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name

LIMIT 1;

/*Now, we want to look at the number of events on each channel this company
had, which we can match with just the id. */

SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
