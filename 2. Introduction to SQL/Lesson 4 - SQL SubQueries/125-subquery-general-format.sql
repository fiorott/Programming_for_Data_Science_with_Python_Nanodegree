SUB QUERY general format

SELECT *
FROM (
     ) Alias_name
GROUP BY
ORDER BY ;


/*
Format Rules:

1. The original query goes in the FROM statement.
2. An * is used in the SELECT statement to pull all of the data from the
original query (if needed to pull all the data inside the sub-query).
3. You MUST use an alias for the table you nest within the outer query.
