LAG & LEAD functions

Display the sum of standard_qty for each account along with its
LEAD column and find the LEAD difference for each account.

Useful Tip:

lead_difference : which subtracts the standard_sum value from the value in lag
column for each row in the table

Each value in lead_difference is comparing the row values between the 2 columns
(standard_sum and lead). E.g., for account_id 1901, the value in lead_difference
will compare the value 0 (standard_sum for account_id 1901) with 79 (lead for
account_id 1901) resulting in 79. This goes on for each row in the table.
