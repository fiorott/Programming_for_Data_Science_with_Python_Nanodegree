/*
NOTES:

1. A window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that
are somehow related to the current row. This is comparable to the type of
calculation that can be done with an aggregate function.

2. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not
cause rows to become grouped into a single output row â€” the rows retain their
separate identities.

3. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the
current row of the query result.

4. OVER and PARTITION BY, these are key to window functions. Not every window
function uses PARTITION BY; we can also use ORDER BY or no statement at all
depending on the query we want to run.
