Quiz: Running_total

Question 1:
create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over
order time with no date truncation. Your final table should have two columns:
one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the
running total.

SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders;

/*
