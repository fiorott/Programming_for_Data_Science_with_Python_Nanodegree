1. The number inside the NTILE(num) will decide, on how many equal parts the
'list of standard_qty' should be divided into.
2. The ORDER BY clause will decide the column on which to work with.
3. The resulting value in each row shows which category/part the value in
standard_qty will fall into.

Note:
when you use a NTILE function but the number of rows in the partition is less
than the NTILE(number of groups), then NTILE will divide the rows into as many
groups as there are members (rows) in the set but then stop short of the
requested number of groups. If you’re working with very small windows, keep
this in mind and consider using quartiles or similarly small bands.

For example, If you only had two records and you were measuring percentiles,
you’d expect one record to define the 1st percentile, and the other record to
define the 100th percentile. Using the NTILE function, what you’d actually see
is one record in the 1st percentile, and one in the 2nd percentile.
