# Explore US Bikeshare Data
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Written code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

## Project overview:
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.

In this project, you will use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

## The Datasets:
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year

## Statistics Computed:
Analyzed the data related to bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, written code to provide the following information:

##### 1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time):
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day

##### 2. Popular stations and trip:
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

##### 3. Trip duration:
* total travel time
* average travel time

##### 4. User info:
* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


## Technologies Used:
+ **Python**
    > Used Python programming language to explore data related to bikeshare.

+ **Numpy and Pandas**
    > Used to explore and manipulate DataFrames and performed statistical analysis.

+ **Visual Studio Code**
    > Used to make exploratory analysis and write appropriate SQL queries to answer the posed questions.

+ **Git Version Control**
    > Used to control and record the project files. Shared the work on GitHub profile.


### Project Rubric

The project must meet all the requirements mentioned in the rubric for the submission to pass.

#### **Code Quality**

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS |
| ------ | ------ |
| Functionality of code | All code cells can be run without error. |
| Choice of data types and structures | Appropriate data types (e.g. strings, floats) and data structures (e.g. lists, dictionaries) are chosen to carry out the required analysis tasks. |
| Use of loops and conditional statements | Loops and conditional statements are used to process the data correctly. |
| Use of packages | Packages are used to carry out advanced tasks. |
| Use of functions | Functions are used to reduce repetitive code. |
| Use of good coding practices | Docstrings, comments, and variable names enable readability of the code. |

#### **Script and Questions**

| CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS |
| ------ | ------ |
| Solicit and handle raw user input | Raw input is solicited and handled correctly to guide the interactive question-answering experience; no errors are thrown when unexpected input is entered. |
| Use descriptive statistics to answer questions about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user. | Descriptive statistics are correctly computed and used to answer the questions posed about the data. Raw data is displayed upon request by the user in this manner: Script should prompt the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, display that data if the answer is 'yes', and continue these prompts and displays until the user says 'no'. |

#### **Suggestions to Make the Project Stand Out!**

| Submission Phase, Reviewer Tips | 
| ------------ |
| Change the structure of bikeshare.py to make the code more efficient or in better style. | |
| Ask and answer additional questions about the data beyond the questions already provided. |  |
| Make the interactive experience wow-worthy! Add images, make it into a web app, etc. (If you do create a web app, make sure to include clear directions how to execute it.) Make it your own! |  |


## Standouts:

```The script is structured well and passed the pycodestyle```


## Software requirements:
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
* You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
* A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
* A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
